# Python 3 data types are int, float, complex

# int doesn't have a size limit
# float example is 12.2
# int is considerablly less process intense than float.

#operators examples

a = 12
b = 3
c = 15.5 # float example Adn you can't use float values as range in python. for i in range (1,4) # not range(1, 4.0)

print(a / b) # a/b si called the expression. Expression is anything that evaluates something. even a = 10 is an expression
print(a // b)
print(a % b)

# anything that python need to figure out is an expression. even simple print(a) is an expression as python -
# need to figure out the value of a
# in a = 2 a is not an expression as a is the just bound-to value
# another example is for i in range(1,4), i is not an expression as a is the just bound-to value

# Operator precedence means, math have priority of operators while performing calculation on an with /,*,+,-
# Operator precedence acronym example is PEMDAS - peranthesis, exponentials, multiplication/division, add/sub or BADMAS
# Multi and Div have same precedence. In a same way add/sub have same precedence.
# you need to calculate from left to right if you encounter any two of those with same precedence
